# SplitADV
The source codes for paper titled "On the Robustness of Split Learning against Adversarial Attack". We are organizing the source codes of our paper and improving its cleanliness and readability by adding comments. Furthermore, we are including necessary copyright claims to ensure proper usage. We have uploaded some codes. Our team is committed to completing all the necessary tasks by July, which includes providing detailed instructions to enable the replication of our experiments.
